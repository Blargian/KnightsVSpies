## Development Log

### Project setup 

Kind of been stuck in tutorial hell a little bit. I like tutorials but I get bored of them very easily because I feel like I'm not making enough progress. I would rather just build something and learn as I go. With that said I am now trying to get the project set up so I can have express serve up React with typescript. 

This [article](https://nils-mehlhorn.de/posts/typescript-nodejs-react-ssr) article seems to give a good overview of what I want to do. 

Next I want to get Jest setup so that I can write unit tests. I'll try the guide for getting setup with webpack [here](https://jestjs.io/docs/webpack)
