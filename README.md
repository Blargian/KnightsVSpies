## About the project  
Spy spy is a turn based realtime multiplayer online game inspired by the social role-playing card based game [the resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resistance_(game)). In the game players are either spies or knights and play successive rounds in which they go on "missions". Players can vote to pass or fail missions and the goal of the game is for the spies to sabotage the missions and for the knights to successfully pass the missions. The purpose of this offering is to create a simple, user friendly and fun to use interface that friends can use to play together online from a distance.
